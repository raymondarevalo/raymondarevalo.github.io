        <div class="section-body">
          When redesigning checkout, our first major challenge was providing
          subscription sizes that worked for the user. In previous iterations,
          we allowed customers to choose a subscription size of 6, 12, or 24
          jars. However, this model provided too much or too little food for our
          customers.

          Our second major challenge was speeding up our food selection process.
          In previous iterations, we allowed customers to browse and add
          individual jars to their cart. Choosing from 18 flavors proved to be
          taxing on the user.

        <div class="section-body">
          To guide the user towards a plan size that worked for them, we aligned
          our plan sizes around a breakfast, lunch, and dinner mental model and
          changed our offerings to 1 a day, 2 a day, and 3 a day &ndash; 7, 14,
          21 jars. Changing our subscription plan sizes not only made it easier
          to conceptualize the offering, but also changed the perception of the
          business from selling food to selling a service. A service that would
          be easily understood in societies that are based off of a breakfast,
          lunch, and dinner routine.
          <br />
          <br />
          To visually help users understand our offerings, we made plan size
          selection dynamic. We replaced a static image with dynamic jars that
          changed depending on the plan size selected.

        <div class="section-body">
          The first step in speeding up our food selection process was to get
          rid of customization in checkout and instead rely heavily on prebuilt
          plan types, which increased conversion significantly.
          <br /><br />
          The second step was providing an intuitive way of viewing the user's
          first shipment of Yumi. Through user observation, we were able to
          identify an area of delay coming from users going back and forth
          between step 3 and 4 of checkout to see their plan type and first
          shipment. Our solution was to merge the components into one step. With
          a few prototype iterations we were able to optimize screen usage. We
          stepped away from a 2 column, multi row experience of viewing menu
          items, to a single horizontal scrollable row.

          By harnessing the power of mental models and limiting choices, we were
          able to provide an experience that was quick and easy to use. The
          final product allowed users to pick a plan size of '1 a day, 2 a day,
          and 3 a day' and a selection of prebuilt plan types. With both of
          these decisions leading to higher conversion rates, I can say I have
          left an impact on how Yumi markets their subscription services.
          <br /><br />

          Working on Yumi's checkout was my first experience of dealing with the
          hard reality of being a designer at a early-stage, fast-growing
          startup. It gave me opportunities to learn more about product design,
          branding, and front-end development. Most importantly, it gave me
          opportunities to develop fundamental soft skills such as: adapting to
          the different roles required of me, learning how to effectively
          collaborate with developers and managers, and curiosity with the
          unknown.
