                        At the core of Yumi's checkout experience is a delightful way of selecting age specific weekly subscription services of baby food. Users select the quantity and type of baby food, while viewing the contents of their first order.

            <div class="section-body">
                        The main challenge I faced was creating an experience that allowed for fast conversion. Our previous experience of allowing the customer to customize their order proved to be ineffective. The mechanism of adding jars in a customize order was too confusing for the first iteration with the user. After removing customization in checkout, the challenge was narrowed down to providing an experience where the user could easily see the food they'll be receiving the following weeks: menu plan and first box contents.

                <div class="section-body">
                                The second challenge I faced was optimizing the experience of selecting subscription sizes. What factors would lead to higher conversion rates? Which visual elements conveyed the meaning of subscription size?

            <div class="section-body">
                        In order to speed up conversion rates, we needed to eliminate areas of delay. This lead me to limit the experience of selecting plan type and viewing first box contents to a single step. This required us to move the first order content view component from step 4 to step 3 of checkout. Furthermore, this required us to optimize screen usage of the first half being allocated to menu plan type and the latter half being allocated to next week order contents. To help the user navigate this page, I decided to move from a 2 column, multi row experience of viewing menu items, to a single horizontally scrollable row.

                <div class="section-body">
                To guide the user towards a plan size that made sense for them, we had to shape the langue used in our offerings. Instead of selecting a plan size of “7, 14, 21” the user was able to select a plan size of “1 a day, 2 a day, and 3 a day.” Changing the use of language not only made it easier to conceptualize the offering, but also changed the perception of the business from selling food to selling a service for your child. A service that would be easily understood in societies that are based off of a breakfast, lunch, and dinner routine. To help users understand our offerings, we made plan size selection dynamic. We replaced a static image with dynamic jars that changed depending on the plan size selected.

                        By harnessing the power of mental models and limiting choices, we were able to provide an experience that was quick and easy to use. The final product allowed users to pick a plan size of '1 a day, 2 a day, and 3 a day' and a plan type of 'milestone, starters only, and variety'. With both of these decisions leading to higher conversion rates, I can say I have left an impact on how Yumi markets their subscription services.
                        <br><br>
                        Working on Yumi's checkout has given me a lot of opportunities to learn more about product design, branding, and front-end development. Consequently, I was able to develop soft skills along the way such as: adapting to the different roles required of me, and learning how to effectively collaborate with developers and managers.
