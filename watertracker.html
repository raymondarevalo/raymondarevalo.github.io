          </div>
          <div class ="description">
            The first step to this project was to define the design problem and opportunity of water conservation at UC San Diego.
            <br /><br />
            Interviews and observations were conducted to reveal that mainly on-campus students were still unaware of why they should cultivate water-saving habits and many (primarily on-campus residents) seemed to use excessive amounts of water despite admitting to it. Off-campus student residents had the incentive of reducing their monthly water bill price as a reason to save water whereas the on-campus student residents did not have any significant source of motivation. This research revealed that the issue of water conservation predominantly exists within the scope of on-campus residents.

            <br /><br />
            Hence, our design challenge: Educate and inspire on-campus UCSD student residents about water conservation while reducing the amount of water being consumed in dormitories.

            <b>Part 2</b> Target Audience
          </div>

          <div class ="description">
            The second step to this project was to define our target audience and their relevance to our design challenge.

            <br /><br />
            Our target audience is primarily students who are on college campuses. Defining features of a student include being generally busy, sleep-deprived and involved. Most college students are always on the go, and have many things that are planned out during the day.
            <br /><br />


            Since these individuals represent a diverse set of students who attend UC San Diego, these students tended to be characterized with or have had exposure to liberal values and opinions, and share some knowledge on how a college community feels like. Considering that the campus is located in an area that was plagued with a drought for the last few years, these students did have some minor knowledge of water conservation.  Additionally, since we mostly targeted individuals associated with Muir College, these students tended to be more environmentally conscious. By targeting people who live on campus and people who live off campus, we found various attitudes towards conserving water.

            <br /><br />
            Aided by research through interviews, surveys, and observations, we were able to conclude that our design problem is relevant to UCSD students who live on-campus. Many students we interviewed had expressed to us how they use water throughout the day in many ways aside from hydration purposes as they do not feel that they are threatened by a shortage of water. When it came down to the issue of awareness regarding water conservation, the students who lived on-campus often stated that they are not worried about saving water because they do not have to pay any sort of monthly bill based on usage in the dormitories. In contrast, the off-campus students we had interviewed overwhelmingly made clear that they pay closer attention to water usage as they pay for their monthly utilities based on the amount consumed. This lack of awareness among on-campus students makes them more prone to using water wastefully, tying in directly to our design problem.
