          <div class="content">
            The project is a redesign of Amtrak's website. We wanted to redesign the process of purchasing a train ticket that would lead to better user satisfaction. The challenge was choosing one simple component, or one step in purchasing a train ticket, to redesign that would yield the best results in leading to better user satisfaction. Wouldn’t it be better to select round trip tickets without a hassle?
            <br><br>
            The project was designed along with 3 other students in COGS 187a, a UX course at UC San Diego. It was part of a design sprint and played as our final. My role in the project was to conduct user testing, analyze and gain insight from user testing, create digital mockups, and create a final design rationale.

          <div class="content">
            To understand how users purchased train tickets, our team observed 3 users perform seven tasks while they simultaneously performed think-alouds. We took notes about anything we notice to be interesting, particularly points where the user was confused or couldn’t get the task done.

            The next step we took was to analyze the results of our fact finding study. We wanted to know what worked and what did not. We ended up finding the route selection component to be a problematic area. In said area, our users encountered an overwhelming amount of information presented to them. Looking through different routes for train tickets was just plain out hard.

          <div class="content">
            We reframed our design problem as: "How to make the route results page show all the route information in a manner that doesn't overwhelm the user?". In other words, our redesign focuses on making the route results component show all the route information in a more concise and organized manner so that the user does not have to scroll down to see more options or get confused in the process of purchasing their ticket.

          <div class="subtitle">Ideation</div>
          <div class="content">
            In order to find efficient and effective workflow, our team created 2 distinct redesigns that had distinct solutions in solving the design problem.
            <br><br>
            Our first redesign focused on maintaining the functionality of Amtrak while reducing the cognitive workload on the user. When reviewing Amtrak's current design, we noticed that the following as influencers to the cognitive overload: lack of distinguishing ticket options, lack of minimalist design, and the grand scope each ticket option took. To help the user distinguish ticket options apart, we decided to increase the spacing between the blocks and make each block stand out with a white background against the site's grey background. To make the design minimal, we decided to get rid of the journey option on the top and the available information in the header as we thought these dialogues contained irrelevant or rarely needed information. We used this design decision to prompt the design decision of including the train route information in the search bar. This decision gives the user control, freedom, and flexibility in changing their train routes. Lastly, to minimize the user's memory load, we compressed the train route information into a scope that was easy for the user to analyze and process. We hid the transfers information under the itinerary and put the ticket options and prices into one side of the screen.
            <br><br>
            Our second redesign focused on condensing each train option into one element (or row) on the page. Originally, one option for a train would encompass the entire web page. Now, the user can see the total amount of time, destination, number of transfers, and a separate full itinerary all within eye level. The user can also click through the different types of tickets and its prices on the drop down, then easily add it to the cart. The overall goal is to condense and reorganize the most information presented to the users trying to purchase a ticket. Not only does it minimize the confusion and workload for the users to understand, it still provides the required information needed for a user to make a complete decision.

            After ideating potential solutions, I used figma to remake the workflow of the problematic component of the site. I translated our design decisions of the first redesign onto a digital mockup version. My team used InVision to add interactivity to the prototype.

          <div class="break"></div>
          <div class="subtitle">Test Prototype</div>
          <div class="content">
            To understand the strengths and weakness of our redesigns, we tested our redesign on 3 different users. We evaluated and compared the 2 redesigns against each other and set variables on how we were going to decide whether any of our redesigns were better.

          <div class="title">Conclusion</div>
          <div class="subtitle">Testing rationale</div>
          <div class="content">
            After having the original test users perform tasks on the first redesign prototype and the original Amtrak website and answer interview questions, we found that the first redesign did prove to work better than the original Amtrak website.
            <br><br>
            Regarding our first redesign, our approach to helping the user distinguish ticket options apart did lead to better user satisfaction. As seen in user interviews, users said that the price selection was easier overall in the redesign than in the original Amtrak website. This was due to the color gradient acting as a means of recognition rather than recall. Furthermore, our approach to making the design minimal did lead to better user satisfaction as it helped the users navigate each page with less hassle. Lastly, our approach to compressing the scope to minimize the user's memory load did lead to better user satisfaction. As seen in our interviews, all three users in our second user testing round mentioned that the stops were easier to see in the first redesign prototype because it was simple and displayed only the immediately relevant information. They stated that the original Amtrak website had too much information as it listed out each transfer stop explicitly, making the page too cluttered.

          <div class="break"></div>
          <div class="subtitle">Lessons learned</div>
          <div class="content">
            Unfortunately we were not able to conduct user testing on our second redesign and therefore unable to validate our design decisions. If we had more time to complete the project, we would have conducted testing on our second redesign. Additionally, we would have conducted more testing to validate the impact of our design solution. Lastly, we would have done a few more iterations of ideation to produce a better and more data-driven design solution.

          <div class="subtitle">Final thoughts</div>
          <div class="content">
            Overall, the project gave me a lot of insight on rapid prototyping. As part of our final for our class, the project was meant to challenge us to define and solve the design problem of a random topic of our choosing. From making a user test plan to creating fast prototypes of two design solutions, I was able gain experience with a design sprint.
