          The project is a working prototype of a functional website for 21
          Below, a dessert shop located in San Diego, CA. We wanted to design a
          website that understood the goals and needs of both the client and
          potential customers in order to create a functional website that met
          and exceeded the client's expectations. The challenge our team faced
          was that the current marketplace of Yelp already existed as a platform
          for businesses to gain recognition. What would a website offer that
          Yelp didn't already offer?
          <br /><br />
          This project was designed along with 3 other students in COGS 187B, a
          UX course at UC San Diego. Throughout the 10 week process, my team and
          I conducted primary and secondary research through think aloud
          interviews and competitive analysis, created a creative brief, mood
          boards, wireframes, and functional prototypes through the use of HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

        <div class="section-body">
          In order to fully understand the objective of learning the practical
          side of working with a client to create a website that works and meets
          their expectations, our design process was structured according to the
          deliverables that a professional web team would provide.This set of
          deliverables can be split off into two main phases. In our first
          phase, the Understand phase, we conducted interviews, composed a
          competitive analysis, created personas and a moodboard of the client.
          In our second phase, the Create phase, we defined the design problem,
          wireframed and developed a functional specialization document,
          ideated, prototyped, tested, and reframed to produced a final high-res
          prototype.

        <div class="section-subtitle psc-top">Client interview</div>
        <div class="section-body">
          In order to understand the goals of our client, our team interviewed
          our client with general questions about their business. We discovered
          the objectives of the client to include: detailed menu, email list,
          emphasis on unique products, photo gallery, and information on the
          services the business offered.
        </div>
        <div class="section-subtitle psc-top">User interviews</div>
        <div class="section-body">
          To understand the context in which our system would be used, our team
          conducted 14 interviews on users aged 20-38. We discovered the users
          typically wanted: an image based menu, hours and location of the
          store, mobile-friendly site, product recommendations, and information
          on dietary accommodation. From this analysis, we constructed 3 user
          personas of the typical users of the dessert shop. The user personas
          included: The Newbie, The Regular, and The Connoisseur.
        </div>
        <div class="section-subtitle psc-top">Competative Analysis</div>
        <div class="section-body">
          To understand the strengths of the competitors within our market in
          order to identify the things we can use on own site, our team did a
          competitive analysis of the brand, functionality, content, site
          architecture, navigation, and design used in 85C Bakery Cafe,
          Iceskimo, SOMISOMI, and Sul & Beans.
          <br /><br />
          What we discovered was that every aspect of the site should focus on
          being responsive and "mobile first." The menu format, navigation bar,
          and pictures should be set up in a format that is minimal and not
          cluttered. Secondly, we discovered that brand style should be
          incorporated with the log to give off a friendly vibe, using cool
          colors such as blue in the color scheme. Furthermore, we found that
          there needed to be some source of imagery of the product with the
          "about us" section to develop personality and a connection with the
          user. Lastly, we discovered that we needed an emphasis on pictures of
          the product and social media as it was important for a dessert
          business to bring in customers in with their aesthetic appeal.

          In order to narrow down on a particular style or concept of what our
          site should be based off of, we developed a moodboard of images,
          materials, and pieces of text that were found in the store and other
          shops.
          <br /><br />
          What we discovered was that our design should be cool, sharp, modern,
          and friendly.

        <div class="section-body">
          After completing user research, we reframed our design challenge as:
          "How to create a website that met the client's and users' objectives
          in manner that is different from Yelp?".

        <div class="section-title">Solutions</div>
        <div class="section-body">
          After immersing ourselves with the stakeholders through user
          interviews, understanding the market though a competitive analysis,
          and defining our potential product and its design challenge, we began
          to ideate and wireframe potential design solutions. We took in what we
          learned from the previous stated sections, and the already
          set-in-stone guidelines of the project to base our wireframes off of.
          We produced individual wireframes on paper, then came together to work
          as a team to produce a cohesive solution on a whiteboard. After
          several days of discussing the requirements and our interview results,
          we narrowed down our features. The highlight of our decisions include:
          a "what we offer" section in the home page to provide fast knowledge
          of what products the dessert shop has to offer, a fixed menu navbar
          that allows the users to swipe between the main offerings, and a
          picture of the storefront in the contact section in order to prevent
          the user from getting lost. I used figma to bring these wireframes to
          life and apply them to an InVision application to add interactivity to
          the wireframes.

        <div class="section-body">
          After performing 9 in studio think-alouds of users testing our
          wireframe-based InVision application we concluded the following: the
          menu section in the home page should be before the environment
          section, and the email signup should not be a model as it proved to
          only be a distraction to the users.

        <div class="section-body psc-top">
          Through many iterations and user testing of our wireframes, we were
          able to conclude on a final prototype. We started off by looking for a
          template that centered around the menu, since it was crucial for us to
          present the menu items in a simple way. We liked the tabs for various
          item categories, which is the style we had in mind for the menu
          originally. However, the template was a single-page site, so we split
          it up into five pages, because a one-pager is not efficient for a
          mobile-focused design, because it would have too much information on
          one screen. Our navigation bar consists of "Home", "About Us," "Menu,"
          "FAQs," and "Contact Us."

        <div class="section-body psc-top">
          Overall, this project proved to be challenging and rewarding. It was
          my first design-based project working with a client. Working with our
          client was difficult because of the complicated social dynamics that
          arose when having a mutual understanding of what was best for the
          site. But it proved to be very beneficial. At the end of the project I
          had developed a basic technical competence in the different stages of
          professional website creation.
