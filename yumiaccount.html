        <div class="section-body">
          When developing a framework for our dashboard, the first major
          challenge was finding the right balance between function, visual
          elements, and navigation that allowed for a simple and usable
          experience. Since our application would be mainly used via a mobile
          web browser, we had to design against the screen taxing navigation
          bars. This constraint influenced the entire mapping of the user
          experience.

      <div class="project-section-container psc-top psc-bottom">
        <div class="section-body">
          Our second major challenge was making an intuitive way of customizing
          orders. We needed to come up with an experience that was scalable to
          our varying plan sizes &ndash; 7, 14, 21 jars &ndash; but also
          considerate towards our tray size limitations &ndash; each tray
          carried 4 jars.

        <div class="section-body">
          In order to find the right balance, we decided to build our experience
          around a web application approach. Since a majority of users used Yumi
          through their mobile device, we wanted to provide an experience that
          resembled their typical behavior with web services. Our web
          application was divided into the following 3 sections: dashboard,
          where the user was able to view their upcoming order and manage
          referrals, orders, where the user was able to manage future orders and
          rate previous orders, and profile, where the user was able to view
          their child's milestone progress and manage their settings. To further
          help with usability, we decided to use sub navigation bars to help the
          user navigate between functions.

      <div class="project-section-container psc-top psc-bottom">
        <div class="section-body">
          In order to make our customize order experience intuitive, we needed
          to find a way to direct the user through customizing in a simple
          manner while limiting navigation. To guide the user through their
          shopping experience, we visually designed our shopping cart and menu
          items into matching modular components that directed the user to build
          their order in building blocks. The user would have to add a menu item
          of 4 jars into an empty shopping cart block of 4. We decided to make
          our modular trays into sizes of 4 jars in order to scale with our plan
          sizes. To limit vertical navigation, we decided to split our jars into
          sub categories and use carousels to navigate each sub category.

          With its 3rd update since launch, I can say I have started a scalable
          framework for Yumi's e-commerce hub. Working in a fast-growing startup
          made me wear a lot of hats. From leading this project from concept to
          development, to designing wireframes and high fidelity mockups, I have
          tested a majority of my design process. On the soft side, I've learned
          how to understand the technical side of development and work with
          engineering constraints, and pushed myself past the ego towards being
          a team player.
