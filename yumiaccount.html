                At the center of Yumi's dashboard is a web application built to bring a simple and familiar experience to Yumi's e-commerce experience. Users were able to view their upcoming orders, mange their future orders, rate their previous orders, and track their child's milestone progress.

                    The first major challenge was finding the right balance between function, visual elements, and navigation that allowed for a simple and usable experience. Since our application would be mainly used via a mobile web browser, we had to design against the screen taxing navigation bars. This constraint influenced the entire mapping of the user experience.

                <div class="section-body">
                        The second challenge I faced was creating an an intuitive experience that allowed users to customize their order. We needed to come up with an experience that was scalable to our varying plan sizes, but also considerate towards our tray size limitations.

            <div class="section-body">
                    In order to find the right balance, we decided to build our experience around a web application approach. Since a majority of users used Yumi through their mobile device, we wanted to provide an experience that resembled their typical behavior with web services. Our web application was divided into the following 3 sections: dashboard, where the user was able to view their upcoming order and manage referrals, orders, where the user was able to manage future orders and rate previous orders, and profile, where the user was able to view their child's milestone progress and manage their settings. To further help with usability, we decided to use sub navigation bars to help the user navigate between functions. Through sub navigation bars, the user was able to navigate between all the future orders, and future orders and previous orders within a minimum of 2 actions.

                <div class="section-body">
                        In order to make our customize order experience intuitive, we needed to find a way to direct the user through customizing in a simple manner while limiting navigation. To guide the user through their shopping experience, we visually designed our shopping cart and menu items into matching modular components that promoted the user to build their order in building blocks.  The user would have to add a menu item of 4 jars into an empty shopping cart block of 4. We decided to make our modular trays into sizes of 4 jars in order to scale with our plan sizes. To limit navigation, we decided to split our items into sub categories and use horizontal scroll bars to navigate between menu items within each sub category.

                        With its 3rd update since launch, I can say I have started a scalable framework for Yumi's e-commerce hub. Working in a fast-growing startup made me wear a lot of hats. From leading this project from concept to development, to designing wireframes and high fidelity mockups, I have tested a majority of my design process. On the soft side, I've learned how to understand the technical side of development and work with engineering constraints, and pushed myself past the ego towards being a team player.
